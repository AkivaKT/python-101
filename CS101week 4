# 04: CS101 Team Activity
# 
# These are simple coding problems.  You will not be submitting anything
# for points.  Please work together on this.  Add your code for every
# TODO section.  Copy this code to Thonny, or your python system.
# Use the print() function to get the output that is in the double quotes.
#
# This team activity is on Boolean Expressions and if statements

# Convert US to Euro
#
# Write a program to request a dollar amount from the user and convert
# it to Euros.  Find the current change rate from the Internet and use
# it in your program
#
# Example output of your program where the user enters 100.0 dollars
#
# Enter dollars: 100.0
# 100.0 dollars is 85.0 Euros
# -------------------------------------------------------------------

x = input('Enter US dollars: ')
y = float(x) * 0.85
print ( x, "US dollars is", y, 'Euros')


# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Compute tax rate
#
# Write a program to request yearly income from the user.  Your program
# will calculate the tax rate for that income
#
# Tax Rates:
#
# Income                  Rate
# 0.0 up to 10000.0        10
# 10000.0 up to 20000.0    20
# 20000.0 up to 100000.0   30
# over 100000.0            35
#
# Example output of your program where the user enters income of 12345.00
#
# Enter income: 12345.00
# Your tax rate is 20%
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
